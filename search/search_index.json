No, LoRa has low bandwidth therefore it is not capable of transmitting large amounts of data. Is a toaster IoT? A toaster is IoT if and only if it is able to connect to the internet and transmit data. Selected Videos Definitions Bandwidth The capacity for data transfer of an electronic communications system https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bandwidth . Lesson 2: Network Building a LoRa Gateway and End Node Recap: What is LoRa? LoRa stands for long-range. LoRa and LoRaWan Low power communication Affordable communication Future of technology The Microprocessor No matter what we are building-Gateway or end Noode the device needs to have a microprocessor to control it. Raspberry Pi's and Arduino's are well known microprocessors. Eventually build nodes using a microprocessor. Assignment 2: Websearch Answer questions about LoRa using the internet. Lesson 3: The Things Nework The Things Network is decentralized community that share gateways for use by lower power devices. This network is powered by LoRaWAN, the message protocol that uses LoRa radio technology. Communities: The Things Network can create groups based on cities. Viewing a community lets you see how functional a city is, displaying the number of members, gateways, etc. This is useful to determine if your city is ready or needs additional support. Labs: The Things Network includes a page for creators to post their applications and tutorials for how to build. Console: Console on The Things Network is used for logged in users to edit and add gateways and applications to your account. Today we will walkthrough the website. Assignment 3 This weeks assignment will take a turn from LoRa, and will guide you in the background of how the internet works. This is something important to know, and will also be helpful when learning how LoRaWAN works. LoRaWAN has to use the internet to transfer data from a gateway to your user application. The assignment will be another web search, this time more challenging. These questions will be on how internet protocols work to send data. Google Forum will be ready to begin Tuesday Morning.","title":"Discussions"},{"location":"#lesson-1-what-is-the-lora-network","text":"Can you use the LoRa Network to stream YouTube videos?

I received the package continuing the LORA Kit. I brought it into my room and began opening each item Each group of items was photographed Each photograph was given to Ramiro Gonzalez I began to look on youtube on how to program and assemble the kit, sadly no luck. I went on the Draginuo website and found the user manual and began to program and assemble based off of the steps and images. The kit required at the start Arduino and a drivers download so the computer can detect when an item from the kit is connected wirelessly or through the USB port. I have a mac and finding how to download the drivers software was difficult. I found this website with a video and preexisting commands for my terminal so i can download and install It didn't do anything, I tried it twice, and my computer still wasn't picking it up I asked my team for some help and I had to wait a couple days until they figured it out. Armaan found this website that didn't need the terminal, and I downloaded it. The driver worked and my computer could detect the devices from the kit Next on the instructions we moved to making a gateway. This involved connecting to the LGO-1 N network and using the http://10.130.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin link I needed to scan for my home internet connection and connect it. I had to disable the previous LGO-1 N connection Once i tried to connect to my home internet, my LGO-1 N crashed and said it failed to back up I tired to stop it from doing that bty redoing the steps multiple times but it kept crashing It disconnected me from the LGO-1N and kept connecting to my internet, this was supposed to happen but at a later step. -It kept asking me to do \u201c add the next back up\u201d , so I did think it would change the outcome, but by doing so it just made my LGO-1N undetectable and now I can\u2019t connect to it. THat is where i am now, stuck on step \u2158 on the instructions on making a gateway.","title":"Gateway"},{"location":"gateway/#install-arduino-ide-and-ch340-driver","text":"","title":"Install Arduino IDE and CH340 driver"},{"location":"gateway/#installing-arduino-ide-a","text":"https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software (Linux)Using the command line sudo apt install arduino CH340 Driver: https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html (Make sure the arduino uno is connected when installing the driver) Tools -> Board -> Arduino Uno Tools -> PORT -> COM4 (May be different, for windows check device manager -> COMM & LP -> USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM?)","title":"Installing Arduino IDE a"},{"location":"gateway/#lg01-n-gateway","text":"Things you will need: LG01-N and RJ45 cable (Ethernet Cable) Configure LG01-N for internet connection","title":"LG01-N Gateway"},{"location":"gateway/#julian-grados-reflection-of-setting-up-lora","text":"My History Process with the LORA: 1.
